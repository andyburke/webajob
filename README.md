This is for historical reference.

This was an attempt by some friends of mine and I to make a social job site, maybe in
2003-2004?

It's interesting because we developed an RPC layer and made a bunch of micro servers for
handling various aspects of the app.  We had a nice little admin console where you could see
the status of the servers, etc.

I liked the concept, but we never really finished everything. :(
